# Beginner to Intermediate Metta Language Practice Code

**This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate level practice examples written in the Metta programming language.**

---

## üìò Overview

This repository is designed to help learners progress from basic to more intermediate-level understanding of the **Metta language**, used in the **OpenCog Hyperon** ecosystem for symbolic reasoning and cognitive architecture development.

Each file in this repository contains small, focused examples that demonstrate fundamental and intermediate Metta concepts such as pattern matching, list manipulation, recursion, and function definitions.

> üí° **Recommended:** Try running and modifying each `.metta` file on your local machine to reinforce your understanding.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python 3

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can download the latest version from the official Python website:
üîó [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

### 2. Install Hyperon (Metta Engine)

Metta is powered by the **Hyperon** execution engine. Install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install hyperon==0.2.3
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** For best compatibility with these examples, version `0.2.3` or compatible should be used.

---

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To keep dependencies clean and avoid conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m venv metta-env
source metta-env/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
metta-env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Then, install the required package again inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install hyperon==0.2.3
```

## üöÄ Running the Metta Code

### Step 1: Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tesfalegnp/Metta-Language-Practice.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Repository Folder

```bash
cd Metta-Language-Practice
```

### Step 3: Run Metta Examples

Each `.metta` file contains a self-contained example. Use the Hyperon CLI to run a specific file:

```bash
metta examples/example1.metta
```

Replace `example1.metta` with the filename of the example you'd like to run.
